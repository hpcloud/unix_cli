  Remove one or more containers. By default this command removes a container if it is empty, but you may use the `--force` flag to delete non-empty containers.  Be careful with this flag or you could have a really bad day.

Examples:
  hpcloud containers:remove :my_container                     # Delete 'my_container' (if empty)
  hpcloud containers:remove :tainer1 :tainer2                 # Delete 'tainer1' and 'tainer2' (if empty)
  hpcloud containers:remove :my_container --force             # Delete `my container` (regardless of contents)
  hpcloud containers:remove :my_container -z region-a.geo-1   # Delete the container `my_container` for availability zone 'region-a.geo-1`
