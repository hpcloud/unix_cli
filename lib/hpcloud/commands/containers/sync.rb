  Allow container synchronization using the specified key.  If you are creating a destination for synchronization, only the key should be specified.  If you are creating a source for synchronization, specify a key and location.  The same key must be used in the source and destination.  It is possible to have containers as both a source and destination.  List your synchronization information with the "hpcloud list --sync" command.

Examples:
  hpcloud containers:sync :atainer keyo         # Set up the container :atainer to be a destination for synchronization
  hpcloud containers:sync :btainer keyo atainer # Synchronize :btainer to remote container :atainer
  hpcloud containers:sync :atainer keyo https://region-b.geo-1.objects.hpcloudsvc.com:443/v1/96XXXXXX/btainer     # Create a two way synchronization between :atainer and :btainer
