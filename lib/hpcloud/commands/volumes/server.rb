  List the volumes attached to servers with the device they are using.  Optionally, you may filter by specifying the server name or ID on the command line.

Examples:
  hpcloud volumes:server                                 # List all the attached volumes
  hpcloud volumes:server myServer                        # List the volumes on server `myServer`
  hpcloud volumes:server f9520651                        # List the volumes on server `f9520651`
