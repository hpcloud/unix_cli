  List the security groups in your compute account. You may filter the display by specifying names or IDs of security groups on the command line.  Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud securitygroups                         # List the security groups
  hpcloud securitygroups mysecgrp                # List security group `mysecgrp`
  hpcloud securitygroups -z az-2.region-a.geo-1  # List the security groups for availability zone `az-2.region-a.geo-1`
