  Lists all the networks that are associated with the account. The list begins with identifier and contains name, status, shared, admin state, and subnets.  Optionally, you can filter the list by specifying name or ID.

Examples:
  hpcloud networks       # List all networks
  hpcloud networks 12857174     # List the details for networks with id `12857174`
  hpcloud networks testo # List the details for networks named `testo`
