  Revoke the access control list (ACL) values from the specified container. The supported permissions are `r` (read), `w` (write), or `rw` (read and write). You may specify one or more user fo the given permission.  If you do not specify a user, the permissions are set to public.  Public write permissions are not allowed.

Examples:

  hpcloud acl:revoke :my_container rw bob@example.com # Revoke read and write from bob@example.com from 'my_container'
