  Set the access control list (ACL) values for the specified container. The supported permissions are `r` (read), `w` (write), or `rw` (read and write). You may specify one or more user for the given permission.  If you do not specify a user, the permissions are set to public.  Public write permissions are not allowed.

Examples:
  hpcloud acl:grant :my_container r    # Allow anyone to read 'my_container'
  hpcloud acl:grant :my_container rw bob@example.com sally@example.com # Allow Bob and Sally to read and write 'my_container'
  hpcloud acl:grant :my_container r billy@example.com # Give Billy read permissions to 'my_container'
