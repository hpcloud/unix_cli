  Change the password for an existing server. The password must adhere to the existing security complexity naming rules. Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud servers:password my-server my-password         # Change the password for server 'my-server'
  hpcloud servers:password b8e90a48 'pA$3word'         # Change the password for server 'b8e90a48'
