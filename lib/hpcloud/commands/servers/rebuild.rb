      long_desc <<-DESC
  Rebuild an existing server specified by name or ID. Optionally, you may rebuild the server with a new image.  Rebuilding a server may take some time so it might be necessary to check the status of the server by issuing the command 'hpcloud servers'. Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud servers:rebuild Hal9000    # Rebuild server 'Hal9000'
  hpcloud servers:rebuild 53e78869 c80dfe05   # Rebuild server 53e78869 with image c80dfe05
