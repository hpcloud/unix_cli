      desc "servers:reboot name_or_id [name_or_id ...]", "Reboot a server or servers (specified by server name or ID)."
      long_desc <<-DESC
  Reboot an existing server specified name or ID. Rebooting a server can take some time so it might be necessary to check the status of the server by issuing the command `hpcloud servers`. The default is a soft reboot, but you can specify the `-h` option for a hard reboot. Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud servers:reboot Hal9000    # Reboot server 'Hal9000'
  hpcloud servers:reboot 53e78869 c80dfe05   # Reboot the servers with the IDs 53e78869 and c80dfe05
