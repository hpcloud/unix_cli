  Lists all the routers that are associated with the account. The list begins with identifier and contains name, status, administrative state, and gateways.  Optionally, you can filter the list by specifying name or ID.

Examples:
  hpcloud routers       # List all routers
  hpcloud routers c14411d7     # List the details for routers with id `c14411d7`
  hpcloud routers testo # List the details for routers named `testo`
