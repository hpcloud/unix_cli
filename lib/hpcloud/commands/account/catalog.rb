      long_desc <<-DESC
  Print the service catalog of the specified account.  Optionally, you may specify a particular service to print such as `Compute`.

  You can then configure the catalog for your account with hpcloud account:edit catalog_<service>=<name> so that
   the cli knows how to talk with your particular cloud implementation. For example:
   hpcloud account:edit useast catalog_compute=nova
   See hpcloud help account:edit for more details.

Examples:
  hpcloud account:catalog useast # Print the service catalog of `useast`:
  hpcloud account:catalog useast Compute # Print the compute catalog of `useast`:
