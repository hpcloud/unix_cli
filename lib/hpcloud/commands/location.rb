  hpcloud location :my_container  #  Display the URI for all objects in container `my_container`
  hpcloud location :my_container/file.txt :my_container/other.txt # Display the URIs for the objects `file.txt` and `other.txt` that reside in container `my_container`
  hpcloud location :my_container/file.txt -z region-a.geo-1  # Display the URI for the file `file.txt` that resides in container `my_container` in availability zone `region-a.geo-1`
