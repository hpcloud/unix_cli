      long_desc <<-DESC
  Copy a file between your file system and a container, inside a container, or between containers. You may copy multiple files to a directory or container on one command line.  Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.  Note that a leading colon `:` is required when you specify a container; for example `:my_container`.

Examples:
  hpcloud copy my_file.txt :my_container        # Copy the file `my_file.txt` to container 'my_container'
  hpcloud copy :my_container/file.txt file.txt  # Copy the file `file.txt` from container `my_container` to your local system
  hpcloud copy :logs/today :logs/old/weds       # Copy the file `today` to new location `old/weds` inside container `logs`
  hpcloud copy :one/file.txt :two/file.txt      # Copy file.txt from container `one` to container `two`
  hpcloud copy :one /usr/local                  # Copy container `one` to the `/usr/local` directory on your local system
  hpcloud copy /usr/local :two                  # Copy directory `/usr/local` to container `two`
  hpcloud copy one.txt two.txt :numbers         # Copy text files `one.txt` and `two.txt` to  container `numbers`
  hpcloud copy my_file.txt :my_container -z region-a.geo-1   # Copy the file `my_file.txt` to container 'my_container' for availability zone `region-a.geo-1`
