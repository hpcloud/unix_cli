  View the access control list (ACL) for a container or object. Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud acl :my_container/my_file.txt         # Display the ACL for the object 'my_file.txt'
  hpcloud acl :my_container                     # Display the ACL for the container 'my_container'
  hpcloud acl :my_container -z region-a.geo-1  # Display the ACL for the container 'my_container' for availability zone `region-a.geo-1`
