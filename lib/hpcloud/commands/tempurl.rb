  Create temporary URLS for the given objects. Creating a temporary URL allows you to share an object for a specified period of time making it available to everyone.  Only users with access to the URL can access the file.  You can specify the time period in seconds (s), hours (h), or days (d).  If you do not specify a time period, the default is two days.  Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples: 
  hpcloud tempurl -p7d :my_container/file.txt   # Create a temporary URL for the file `file.txt` with a period of 7 days
  hpcloud tempurl -p24h :my_container/file.txt :my_container/other.txt #  Create temporary URLs for the files `file.txt` and `other.txt` in container `my_container` with a period of 24 hours
  hpcloud tempurl :my_container/file.txt -z region-a.geo-1  # Create a temporary URL for the file `file.txt` with a period of 7 days for availability zone `region-a.geo-1`
