  Installs the HP Cloud bash completion file.  If you run this command as the root user, the file is installed in a system-wide directory (if one is available).  Otherwise, the file is installed  in the `~/.bash_completion.d/` directory.  The `~/.bash_completion.d/` directory is not run by default; you must run the completion script explicitly.
  
Examples:
  hpcloud complete # Installs the HP Cloud bash completion file.
