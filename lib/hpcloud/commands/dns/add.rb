  Add a DNS domain with the specified name and email address.  Optionally, you can specify a TTL (time to live) to adjust DNS caching of your entry.  The default time to live (TTL) is 3600 (one hour).

Examples:
  hpcloud dns:add mydomain.com. email@example.com        # Create a new DNS domain `mydomain.com` with email address `email@example.com`
  hpcloud dns:add mydomain.com. email@xample.com -t 7200 # Create a new DNS domain `mydomain.com` with email address `email@example.com` and time to live 7200
      DESC
