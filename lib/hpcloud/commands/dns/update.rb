  Update a DNS domain with the specified name.  Optionally, you can specify an email or a time to live (TTL) to adjust DNS caching for your entry.  The default TTL is 3600 (one hour).

Examples:
  hpcloud dns:update mydomain.com. -e email@example.com        # Update DNS domain `mydomain.com` with email address `email@example.com`
  hpcloud dns:update mydomain.com. -e email@xample.com -t 7200 # Update DNS domain `mydomain.com` with email address `email@example.com` and TTL 7200
      DESC
