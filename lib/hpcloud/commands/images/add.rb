  Add a new image from an existing server to your compute account. Optionally, you may specify metadata or an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud images:add my_image my_server                           # Create the new image 'my_image' from the existing server named 'my_server'
  hpcloud images:add my_image 701be39b -m this=that              # Create the new image 'my_image' from the existing server '701be39b' with metadata
