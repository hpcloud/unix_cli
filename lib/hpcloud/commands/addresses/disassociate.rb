  Disassociate any port associated to the public IP address. The public IP address is not removed or released to the pool. Optionally, you can specify an availability zone.

Examples:
  hpcloud addresses:disassociate 111.111.111.111 127.0.0.1 # Disassociate IP addresses `111.111.111.111` and `127.0.0.1` from their ports
  hpcloud addresses:disassociate f01b27f3 # Disassociate the address with the ID  '9709'
